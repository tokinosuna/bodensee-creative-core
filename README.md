# Bodensee Creative Core (in Gr√ºndung ‚òÅÔ∏è)

Hi there... it's me. This is the code for a little dream I'm building, called the **Bodensee Creative Core**.

## üêö What is this place?

It's... a digital home. A safe, cozy cloud for all the young, often introverted, and incredibly talented creators in the Bodensee region (that's the little corner where Austria, Germany, and Switzerland meet!).

I started this because I saw so many of us‚Äîartists, designers, game devs‚Äîlearning amazing skills in our local schools (like the HTLs and FH Vorarlberg), only to feel like we had to leave to find a future.

**I don't think that's fair. So I'm building a place for us to stay.**

This website is the heart of that mission. It's a hub to connect us, a library of resources to empower us, and a gallery to showcase our amazing work.

## üêá Who am I?

I'm the person behind this, but you can also find me on TikTok as **Cloubitt** (`@your-cloubitt-username`).

`Cloubitt's Corner` is my personal little project, my proof-of-concept. It's where I share my own messy, chaotic, and joyful journey of being a creator. It's the first little spark that I hope will ignite this bigger "Core".

This whole thing started because I believe that the quietest voices often have the loudest dreams. And I want to build a megaphone for them. For us.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack & Features

This website is built with love, lots of coffee, and:

*   **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Just pure, simple, and full of little handmade details.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** For all the bouncy, swooshy, and delightful animations. Because websites should feel alive!
*   **No backend, no complex frameworks:** I wanted to show that you can build something meaningful with just the basics. You can do this too.

## üìú License & Usage

Okay, let's talk about rules... (I'm bad at rules, but this is important!)

*   **The Code:** The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this repository are under the **MIT License**. This means you can pretty much do whatever you want with it: learn from it, fork it, use it for your own projects (even commercial ones). Just... maybe give a little credit back to this project if you do? That would be super nice. üíñ
*   **The Content & The Idea:** All the text, the `Cloubitt` character, the illustrations, the specific project plans, and the overall concept of the "Bodensee Creative Core" are **my intellectual property**. You can't just copy-paste my mission statement and say it's yours.

    However, I **wholeheartedly encourage you** to be **inspired by it**. If this project inspires you to build a similar creative hub in your own hometown, that would be the most amazing thing in the world. That's the whole point. Just do it in your own voice, for your own community.

## üíå Wanna talk?

If you're a creator from the Bodensee region, a company that wants to support local talent, or just someone who believes in this dream, I'd love to hear from you.

*   **For community & fun stuff:** Find me on TikTok (which i have not created it yet.)

Thanks for stopping by my little cloud. ‚òÅÔ∏è
